# This obfuscation dictionary contains reserved Java keywords. They can't
# be used in Java source files, but they can be used in compiled class files.
# Note that this hardly improves the obfuscation. Decent decompilers can
# automatically replace reserved keywords, and the effect can fairly simply be
# undone by obfuscating again with simpler names.
